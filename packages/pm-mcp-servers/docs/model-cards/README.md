# Model Cards

Model cards provide technical documentation for the AI and analytical models deployed within the PDA Platform. These cards outline model architecture, capabilities, limitations, and ethical considerations.

## Purpose

Model cards are designed to support transparency and accountability for organizations deploying the PDA Platform. They provide structured information useful for regulatory compliance, risk assessment, and stakeholder communication.

## Using Model Cards for ATRS Submissions

If your organization is required to submit AI Technology Risk Statements (ATRS) or similar compliance documentation, the model cards in this directory can be used to support those submissions. They provide detailed information about:

- Model specifications and versions
- Intended use cases and limitations
- Methodology and algorithmic approaches
- Performance characteristics
- Ethical considerations and safeguards

For additional guidance on ATRS submissions and how to leverage these model cards, please refer to [ATRS Guidance](../guides/ATRS_GUIDANCE.md).
