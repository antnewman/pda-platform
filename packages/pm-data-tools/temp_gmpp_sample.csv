The programme received an AMBER rating at its annual review held in September 2023. The reviewers praised the unique and innovative approach to delivery used on the programme and the engagement of delivery partners in its output. In addition, they also highlighted several risks to delivery which required attention by the team. This included for example improved communication with stakeholders over delivery plans and ensuring key personnel and skills are retained. In order to address these challenges the review team provided 12 recommendations for ECDP to implement ahead of the next planned review in October 2024.

This is primarily due to the following factors. 

 Final programme completion remains on schedule as at the end of the reporting year. Since the last annual report a number of Tier 1 milestones have been achieved by the programme including the entry into service of the ETCS testing facility at the Rail Innovation and Development Centre where all ETCS fitted trains will be tested and the commissioning of ETCS infrastructure on the Welwyn to Hitchin Overlay Area, where conventional signals will be retained to allow the progressive training of drivers. In addition to these Tier 1 milestones, the 2023-24 reporting year also saw both the running of ETCS trains and the start of mass-driver training for the first time on the Northern City Line. However, despite overall programme completion remaining on schedule there has been delays to several intermediate milestones over this reporting year. This includes for example milestones related to vehicle fitment and infrastructure commissioning. These delays have primarily been driven by loss of access to the railway to complete infrastructure works and constraints in the supply chain",352.34,297.99,-15,"The budget variance exceeds 5%. This is primarily due to the following factors. The variance from the forecast of costs is broadly down to three factors which has moved spend into later years. Firstly, the impact of industrial action in 2022 led to delays in infrastructure delivery between Welwyn and Hitchin the first area on the mainline to have digital signalling infrastructure fitted, causing a consequential delay to the Key Outcome 1 milestone which covers the removal of signals on this stretch of line resulting in costs slipping to the right. In addition, delays to freight fitment and approvals caused by the complexity of the engineering challenge have also pushed spend to later in the programme. The final factor moving spend to the right has been delays to agreeing the contract for the fitment of the Class 80X fleet, which delayed the start of this project and hence moving costs to later in the programme lifecycle.",3477,"Compared to financial year 22/23-Q4, the project's departmental-agree Whole Life Cost at 23/24-Q4 remained at 3477m. This is primarily due to the following factors. 

 At the end of the reporting year, programme whole life costs have remained stable since the last annual report. Despite inflation remaining a key risk to the programme this has not yet materialised into higher whole life costs through use of contingency and leveraging commercial tools such as bulk purchase of materials to gain cost savings.  As we move in the 2024-25 reporting cycle, the key risk to maintaining overall programme cost will be the affordability of fleet fitment within the freight and OTM sectors. The programme is actively looking at how it can reduce cost in these sectors through working with the sector.",824,"Compared to financial year 22/23-Q4, the project's departmental-agree monetised benefits at 2324-Q4 decreased from 826m. to 824m. 

The programme's benefits profile has remained static compared to last reporting period. As the benefits of digital signalling start to materialise on the Northern City Line, the first area to transition to ETCS, the programme will begin monitoring there accrual in earnest over the coming year. Please note that the benefits reported here are in present value at 2010 prices, whereas whole lifecycle costs are in cash prices, so are not directly comparable."

DFT_0022_1415-Q4,Lower Thames Crossing,DFT,Infrastructure and Construction,"The Lower Thames Crossing (LTC) is a proposed new expressway connecting Kent, Thurrock and Essex through twin-bored tunnels under the Thames. It will almost double the road capacity across the River Thames east of London and is the largest single road investment project in the UK since the M25 was completed more than 30 years ago. As a vital part of the UKs transport infrastructure, it will act as a catalyst for national and local economic growth. Building a reliable, modern new road that is fit for the future will help connect the nation's busiest ports to the distribution hubs in the North, Midlands and beyond. It will improve network resilience and the performance of the existing crossings at Dartford, transforming the regional and national road network.

 The Written Ministerial Statement issued on the 9 March 2023 confirmed government commitment to the Programme and that construction would be rephased by two years, against the current approved baseline.
